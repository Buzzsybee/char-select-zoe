A widdle mod i am developing to start my journey of lua coding

Moveset/Character mod that tries to recreate Zoe from the game HASTE by Landfall games. this moveset features:

* Automatic running state, from which all other actions can be made,(Charge with Z trigger)
* Jumping and landing action, landing after jumping earns you SPEED and ENERGY(Jump with A button)
* Dive down while falling or jumping, this makes you fall faster and earn more energy once you land(A button while falling or jumping)
* Board action, While on ground it boosts your speed, costing you energy. When airborne, it functions as a light boost and a double jump
* Additionally, airtime is higher, making you float for a moment in your jumps to aither get further distances or be able to dive whenever you like.
